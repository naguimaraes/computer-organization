# Computer Organization

This repository is part of the Computer Organization class at UFRGS, taught by Professor Antônio Carlos Schneider Beck Filho.

## Assignments

1. **MIPS Processor Implementation**: Add instructions to MIPS processors in three different architectures (single-cycle, multi-cycle, and 5-stage pipeline). See more details in the [assignment 1 directory](./Assignment1/). This assignment was made in groups of four students, in our case: [Eduarda Pereira](https://github.com/dudatess), [Gabriel Tavares](https://github.com/gct02), [Maximus da Rosa](https://github.com/maximusrosa) and [Nathan Guimarães](https://github.com/naguimaraes).

2. **CPU Performance Analysis with gem5**: Analyze the impact of different CPU configurations on algorithm performance using the gem5 simulator. This assignment involves testing different latencies for multiplication and square root operations across various benchmark algorithms. See more details in the [assignment 2 directory](./Assignment2/). This assignment was made by the same group as Assignment 1, with the inclusion of [Ian Kersz](https://github.com/kerszamaral).
